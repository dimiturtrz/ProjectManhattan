Welcome to the ELSYS Card Wars tutorial!

There are two players in the game - you, and the enemy AI. 
Every player has 30 cards in their deck.
A random player starts the game. 
Every player draws five cards from the deck.
On every turn the player draws one card from the deck.
On every turn you can either play a card, skip your turn or quit the game. 
In order to play a card, you need to have enough mana. 
Your manapool is 1 in the beginning of the game.
It's incremented by one on every turn. 
At the end of each turn all cards attack all other cards.
If there are two cards in one corridor, they attack each other. 
If there is only one card, it attacks the other player's health points. 
The game finishes when either player's health is brought down to 0. 

Enough rules! 
Happy playing!
